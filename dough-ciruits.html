    <h3>Making a circuit using dough</h3>
    <p>Now you have tested your LED circuit, and your code, you can begin to create your creature!</p>
    <p>The salt and water in conductive dough mean that electricity can pass through it. It is not as good as a wire at the job though, and has quite a lot of <em>resistance</em>.</p>
    <p><strong>To help keep the resistance in your circuit down, use the smallest amounts of dough that you can for each connection.</strong></p>
    <br>
    <p>Test out your dough by modifying your LED crocodile clip circuit. You can use our template to help you.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Keep the crocodile clips connected to the micro:bit, but <strong>unplug your LED</strong> from the other ends.</li>
      <li>Take <strong>two small bits of conductive dough</strong>, and roll them into balls.</li>
      <img src=".\images\dough-set-up.JPG" alt="makecode" width="600px" height="auto">
      <li>Push the LED legs into each ball - <strong>make sure they don't touch each other, and remember which leg is the positive and which leg is the negative</strong> - you can use our template to help you.</li>
      <li>Push the crocodile clips that are connected to your micro:bit into the two balls of dough with your LEDs in and test your circuit - does your LED still light up?</li>
      <li>Take a piece of <strong>insulating dough</strong> - this doesn't allow electricity to flow through it, like the plastic around the crocodile clips - and put it between your two conductive balls. Gently push it together so the three bits of dough join togther, then test it again - does your LED still light up?</li>

    </ol>
    <p>If your tests above worked, then you can add more dough pieces and create your creature!</p>
    <p>Remember to keep your pieces small, or the LEDs might not light up!</p>
