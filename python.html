  <div id="intro">
    <p>Resources for the 'Creature Circuits' Creative Computing Club.</p>
    <p>During this workshop, you will create and code a 'creature' using a BBC micro:bit, some conductive and insulating dough, and some electronic components.</p>
    <p>To make your own dough at home, follow the instructions at <a href="https://squishycircuits.com/pages/dough-recipes" target="_blank">Squishy Circuits</a>.</p>
    <p>This page recaps what <a href="https://bit.ly/May21CCC" target="_blank">we discussed as a group</a>.</p>
    <p>To skip to the examples and ideas, <a href="#extensions">click here</a>.</p>

    <h3>Getting started</h3>
    <p><em><a href="index.html" target="_blank">If you would like to do this activity using MakeCode instead, click here!</a></em></p>
    <br>
    <p>Go to <a href="https://python.microbit.org/" target="_blank">the Python editor</a>, then follow the instructions to <a href="https://scienceoxford.github.io/do-your-bit/pair-microbit.html" target="_blank">pair your micro:bit</a>.</p>

    <h3>Adding an LED</h3>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ScienceOxford/ElecKit/master/images/LED_wiring.JPG" alt="LED wiring photo" width="600px" height="auto">
    <p>Take a crocodile clip, and connect one end of it to <strong>pin 0</strong> on your micro:bit.</p>
    <p>Connect the other end of your crocodile clip to the <strong>positive</strong> lead of your LED (the longer one).</p>
    <p>Connect a second crocodile clip between the <strong>GND pin</strong> on your micro:bit, and the <strong>negative</strong> lead of your LED (the shorter one).</p>
    <p>Now try out the below code... what happens to your LED?</p>
    <pre><code>from microbit import *

while True:
    pin0.write_digital(1)
    sleep(500)
    pin0.write_digital(0)
    sleep(500)</code></pre>
    <br>
    <p>What would you need to change in the code if you connected the LED to <strong>pin 1 or 2</strong> instead of pin 0?</p>

    <h3>Making a circuit using dough</h3>
    <p>Now you have tested your LED circuit, and your code, you can begin to create your creature!</p>
    <p>The salt and water in conductive dough mean that electricity can pass through it. It is not as good as a wire at the job though, and has quite a lot of <em>resistance</em>.</p>
    <p><strong>To help keep the resistance in your circuit down, use the smallest amounts of dough that you can for each connection.</strong></p>
    <br>
    <p>Test out your dough by modifying your LED crocodile clip circuit. You can use our template to help you.</p>
    <img src=".\images\creature-circuits-template.png" alt="makecode" width="800px" height="auto">
    <ol>
      <li>Keep the crocodile clips connected to the micro:bit, but <strong>unplug your LED</strong> from the other ends.</li>
      <li>Take <strong>two small bits of conductive dough</strong>, and roll them into balls.</li>
      <li>Push the LED legs into each ball - <strong>make sure they don't touch each other, and remember which leg is the positive and which leg is the negative</strong> - you can use our template to help you.</li>
      <li>Push the crocodile clips that are connected to your micro:bit into the two balls of dough with your LEDs in and test your circuit - does your LED still light up?</li>
      <li>Take a piece of <strong>insulating dough</strong> - this doesn't allow electricity to flow through it, like the plastic around the crocodile clips - and put it between your two conductive balls. Gently push it together so the three bits of dough join togther, then test it again - does your LED still light up?</li>
    </ol>

    <br>
    <p>If your tests above worked, then you can add more dough pieces and create your creature!</p>
    <p>Remember to keep your pieces small, or the LEDs might not light up!</p>
